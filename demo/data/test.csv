8476,Life of a chicketarian,"This is the story about how a boy raised in Argentina was a vegetarian until he worked at McD's and tasted chicken. 
Many of you don’t know this, but I was raised vegetarian in Argentina. Yes, you hear it correctly, the country famous for its traditional 'asado' (barbeque) and one of the top producers and consumers of beef in the world, also produced a vegetarian boy. Argentina has around 51 million head of cattle, and 40 million people, that means that there is more cows than people! So vegetarians there were even less common when I was a child.

Today I will share with you, not only my story but the story of 3 generations and their eating habits. It all started with my parents in the 1960s. My mom became a vegetarian at the age of 16, after spending many months in bed due to a very serious intestinal illness. While in bed she read a lot about nutrition, her father would bring her different books for her to pick from. One day she run into a book about nutrition and vegetarianism. She was so sick of being in bed that she wanted to figure out how to get better. 

She started by drinking drops of carrot juice, then she added other juices and eventually she got better. The doctors could not believe it. She then started doing yoga and read about the importance of energy, and not to eat dead things, and with time she learned the importance of  respecting all lives in the universe, basically she became a true hippie.  

She then met my dad at the university and he also started doing yoga and he also became vegetarian but for philosophical and ethical reasons. So they both started for different reasons but at the end agreed that it was best for them. With time my mom also realized that she was feeling better, healthier, so that assured her that  she was doing  the right thing. 

She continued to read more and more about nutrition and vegetarianism, continued to study yoga, and eventually became a yoga teacher. She also had a passion for compared religions, philosophy, sociology, and psychology and she loved classical music (she was a music teacher for a few years.)

Later on my mom and dad moved to Israel for college and met a Dr who guided her about nutrition during pregnancy and during the first years of a kid’s life. She went to various seminars about nutrition with this doctor. When my sister and I were born, they fed us a vegetarian diet as well. They tried to give us a balanced diet that had enough protein, like whole wheat bread and soy. They also realized that my sister and I were growing strong and healthy so that reassured them that what they were doing was good. 

In the 60s being vegetarian was not common at all, and it was very criticized, especially in a country that eats so much meat. In the 70’s when my sister and I were born, it was a bit more common and by the 80s there were a few restaurants that opened up, there were also a few celebrities that made it public that they were vegetarians and Argentina also started to produce more soy.

While it was a bit more common to not eat meat when I was kid than it was for my parents, it was still a struggle. People looked at me as if I was crazy, and they just didn’t get it. Everytime I went to a friend’s house for lunch or dinner, I will get asked the same stupid questions, here is how it went:

John do you want a ham and cheese sandwich
Not thanks, I don’t eat meat
Oh ok, do you want a steak then?
	No thanks, I don’t eat steak either
Can I give you some chicken? Fish?
	That’s also meat, so no thanks
We would do this for every possible animal that you could possibly eat and at the end they would ask….”So what do you eat??”

With my family this was not that much different, my cousins, uncles, aunts, wouldn’t get it either, even my grandma that lived with us for a while wouldn’t get it, or at least she didn’t want to get it nor believe that it was healthy. And growing up she tried to give us meat any chance she got, she would take us out of the house with any excuse and would buy us a hamburger or hot dog. As kids this was very confusing, who should we believe? My strict parents or my sweet and innocent grandma? As I was writing this story, I was thinking about  sharing this with my mom, but not this part of it, I definitely won’t. You see, if she found out we ate meat, it would have been as bad as if we did cocaine or joined a cult. Many people would also tell us, just eat meat and don’t tell your mom.

I stayed “vegetarian” for many years, I remember one day as a kid, I went to a summer camp and was tempted to eat meat, I cut a piece and put it in my mouth but in my head I heard all the things my mom said about how bad is it it, how toxic it is, the fact that you are eating flesh, that you are eating blood and many other things, so I took the piece out and didn’t eat meat for many years, until one day things change.

When I was in high school, I worked at McDonalds for almost two years, during that time I worked on several areas of the restaurant. One day they put me in the kitchen, so for the first time in my life I had to cook meat, and for the first time I was standing so close to it, smelling it, hearing it cook. The hamburgers were frozen and almost didn’t seem like real meat but the Mac chicken sandwich was something else. While cooking it, I got so tempted that I tried a piece, and it was love at first bite. Out of all places in the world, McDonalds changed me to a meat eater, a carnivore!

For the next 25 years, I just stayed eating chicken, still wouldn’t eat fish, seafood, pork, beef, nothing else. My sister on the other hand continues to be a vegetarian. More than anything she was used to it but over time she also had her own ethical and philosophical reasons to not eat meat. Later in life she tried shellfish, according to her because shellfish don’t feel any pain like chickens or cows would.

Unlike my mom, we both ended up marrying non-vegetarians, actually they both eat a lot of meat, which is good for them because when we get together they can share a steak or a paella, something they could never do with us. Personally it never bothers me that my wife eats meat, the smell never bothers me or her cooking at home. With time she decided there was no point on cooking meat at home for just her, so she mostly ate it when we went out.

Three years after my wife and I started dating, we got married and had our first kid, Gaby, and two years later we had our second, Laura. We were very young when we married and never really discussed how to raise them but I felt pretty strongly that I didn’t want to give them any meat and my wife the opposite. However we both agreed that feeding them lots of veggies was a good idea. I cannot confirm or deny this, but I suspect my wife and her family did the same thing that my grandma did 35 years ago, they gave my kids meat!! So things haven’t changed much in all these years, people still believe that humans need meat to survive and live a healthy life.

For my kids having a semi-vegetarian parent and a carnivore one was confusing, it’s like having parents from different religions (which they also have, but I will tell that story another time) or having parents from different political parties. So while they were very little, they didn’t eat much meat (at least that I was aware of), with time they introduced fish, then chicken, then things changed. Gaby and Laura took different roads. Gaby at an early age of 10, decided she didn’t want to eat any meat, that meant no chicken or fish or seafood either. She is now 18 and has kept this diet and it’s super happy with it. On the other hand Laura went to the dark side and started little by little eating everything, even pork.

Now this make me wonder, if my daughter Gaby continues the tradition that my mother started over 50 years ago, would it continue to my grandkids and great grandkids or die here like the many animals we all eat.

10294,How to hire more women in silicon valey,"In the ad industry, we often read stories and hear accounts about the representation of women in creative roles, especially leadership. The same struggles exist in tech, which remains a predominantly male industry. While almost half of the total workforce in large tech companies is now female, only about 20% of those women actually work in tech roles. 

It’s been continually proven that diverse teams create work that better serves the public. Customers are diverse, so we need to make sure the teams that service them are representing the audience. I was raised by and grew up with women and at an early age learned the value their unique perspective adds to the world. I believe they make teams better, stronger and more successful. As a result, I have personally taken this very seriously and with great support from my extended leadership team, am dedicated to improving the number of diverse engineers in the industry, starting with my team.


This is not easy, nor fast, for various reasons. It takes coordination from many people, and quite a bit of ingenuity and creativity. We’re attracting and recruiting highly qualified individuals in a highly competitive market where almost every big tech company is either headquartered or has a big presence. And guess what? They are also looking to diversify their tech pool.

One of the very first things we needed to look at was process and the curation of the interviewing team. After tooling around with it, we’ve landed on the following steps when hiring a new engineer on the team:

Identify a need:
A need usually generates when the client services or new business teams sell a new project or win a new client. If we don’t have resources locally or within the network to do the work, we open a new request to start sourcing externally. The recruiting team then starts looking for individuals based on a job description associated with that project. Then the team start to interview candidates and eventually finds someone who is a match. Once the candidate accepts our offer, we agree on a start date.

As you can imagine this process takes a long time, especially for companies in the fast-paced innovation business. It also takes effort and commitment (as well as constant reminding) from the people involved to find and hire diverse candidates.

Since most engineers on the market are male, the majority of the people we were interviewing were men, so at the end of the interview process, the majority of the engineers we ended up hiring in the past were...you guessed it, male.

Widen the Pool
To combat our potential traps, and move efficiently, we implemented some changes with a primary focus to hire more women. We tried to start the hiring process earlier. That gave us more time to hire, source, and interview more female engineers for the consideration pool. Our female engineers participated in the first rounds of interviews and were an active part of the decision making process when choosing whom to hire. Not only did female candidates feel more comfortable when meeting with the team, the chances of them joining us increased dramatically. Our female engineers were also able to identify and highlight potential or hidden talents that could have been missed by an all male interviewing panel. In addition they are helping to create a culture where female engineers want to work, feel comfortable and respected.

Hit the Ground
We attended, explored and curated the best bootcamps in the San Francisco area, and started looking for candidates there -- we noticed early on that these bootcamps were much more likely to have diverse candidates. As of 2015, only 15% of computer science college graduates were women (3% were WOC). In 2017, 40% of of in-person Coding Bootcamp graduates were women and 49.5% of of online Coding Bootcamp graduates were women.We also partnered with “Lesbians Who Tech” (Attended and spoke) and “Tech Ladies” to fully engrain ourselves into the communities where we were recruiting. Lastly, we established an internal commitment not to hire anyone until we had interviewed at least three female candidates per each role. Not only did that increased the odds, but also helped train our team to always be on the lookout for potential talent.

After perfecting this for a few cycles, we were able to grow the number of female engineers at R/GA San Francisco – we now have six female engineers out of 14 developers. It can definitely improve but it’s a process that many I am happy to see this results, and the potential of this new process.

3608,Tech Companies Need to Improve Their Voice Assistants to Make Them Inclusive for All Users,"“Alexa play music.” “Sorry, I don’t know the answer to your question.”

“Alexa play music.” “Sorry, I don’t know the answer to your question.”

“Alexa play music.” “Sorry, I don’t know the answer to your question.”

This—or some variation of it—is what happens to my mom whenever she interacts with her Amazon Echo.

And it’s not just Alexa. Every voice-enabled device has trouble understanding accents, whether you’re using Siri, Google Home, Microsoft Cortana, or others. As more devices become voice-enabled, the companies developing them are failing to use diverse enough data to train these systems to be inclusive for all users.

There are about 56 million Latinos living in the U.S., making us the largest minority population in the country. And according to a PwC survey, Latinos as a group are earlier tech adopters than any other. Yet existing devices don’t fully support Spanish or Spanish accents.


If companies care about Latinos, who are predicted to have $1.7 trillion in buying power by 2020, according to The Selig Center for Economic Growth, they should be doing a lot more to ensure their products are fully usable for them. Also there are more and more Latinos graduating from computer science courses. More than 8 percent of Latinos graduated from Computer Science colleges, according to American Community Survey data.

The technology for voice recognition, or ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), takes an acoustic signal as an audio input, tries to determine which words were actually spoken, and then grabs that list of words as text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) then takes this data and extracts the meaning behind it, which can then be mapped to a phrase or command (for example: “Play Beatles radio”). Most NLP (Watson, API.ai, Wit.ai, etc.) platforms do support multiple languages, so once the words are “extracted,” it should be simple enough to understand their meaning.

Chart: Dianna McDougall; Source: NLU course, Stanford University
To better understand most of the pieces that go into building an ASR system, take a look at the graph above from an NLU course at Stanford. Some audio recognition and cognition programs use speech-to-text then NLP to understand the meaning, others like SoundHound, use Speech-to-Meaning technology, so instead of converting the speech to text first and then interpreting the text, they interpret the speech directly.

So the problem is not the NLP, but converting the sounds into words. Startups and academics use an existing collection of audio and transcripts to train their voice-enabled systems. So if this training data doesn’t contain voices with diverse accents, those systems will have a hard time understanding my mom, or anyone else with an accent.

Bigger companies like Amazon and Google use their own training data, but while they use more diverse audio, it’s still not good enough to understand different accents. Alexa has the ability to train its system using your own voice, which is definitely a good way to improve the experience over time.

But the problem is that companies don’t share the training sets they collect, so while one device might understand my mom’s accent better than others, it won’t solve the problem for all voice-enabled devices—or for all different accents.

Until companies start using bigger data sets of diverse accents and start opening up their data to other companies, we will have to repeat the same question over and over—or ask someone without an accent to play that song for us.",REAL
